My name is Mingchang Liu. Now,I am a postdoctoral researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, under the supervision of the [Professor Fredrik Viklund](https://people.kth.se/~frejo/). Before that, I earned my BS degree at Tsinghua university in 2018 and earned my PhD degree at Tsinghua university in 2023, under the supervision of the [Professor Hao Wu](https://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1125/1671.htm). During 2022.12 to 2023.01, I am a visiting student at  University of Vienna, under the supervision of [Professor NathanaÃ«l Berestycki](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/nathanael.berestycki/).

I am interested in many aspects of probability theory, including Schramm-Loewner evolution, uniform spanning tree and the dimer model, Gaussian free field, and Coulomb gas model.
